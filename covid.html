        <p>We have updated our internal mask policy in accordance with the new guidance from the CDC. At this point, if

            the move. Those that are unvaccinated will still be wearing masks during initial walkthrough and close out

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Each mover on our team has their temperature checked with a no-contact thermometer before
                        your
                        move to ensure we are not sending anyone out that has a fever</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Automated messaging to our crews throughout the day to wash hands and avoid touching face.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Requiring employees that exhibit symptoms to stay at home and providing paid sick leave so they
                        are not incentivized to return to work early</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Implemented work from home policies for our office staff</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>New morning procedures and scheduling practices to keep teams isolated and reduce our mover's
                        exposure to the smallest number of people possible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We have supplied each of our team members with cloth masks. If you would prefer your movers to
                        wear masks, they are available upon request. Just let us know!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>IF RAINING: if we are moving during rain or storms, we may not be able to keep our masks on as
                        breathing becomes incredibly difficult once the masks become wet/soiled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>GLOVES: We do not wear gloves while moving. The disposable gloves do not hold up during a move
                        and non disposable options just provide opportunities to cross contaminate customers when moves
                        are conducted back to back. We have found a consistent regimen of hand washing is the safest
                        option.</p>

                    <p>Let us know if you are showing symptoms - As your move date approaches please let us know if you
                        are running a fever and/or if you are suffering from flu like symptoms. We trust that you
                        will
                        keep us informed either through email or by calling to let us know in advance so we can
                        make a
                        decision on a case by case basis if your move should be postponed. If you need to cancel or
                        reschedule, remember we have zero cancellation or reschedule fees so don't hesitate to
                        give our

                    <p>Practice Social Distancing - In observance to the possibilities of coronavirus spreading, we
                        apologize in advance for not shaking hands with you. Please make sure to give our moving team
                        space as they operate within your home or office.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Prep Home in Advance - We ask that you help prep your home or office in advance to our moving
                        team showing up by disinfecting major surfaces, furniture items and appliances, and high traffic
                        areas to limit as much exposure to our team as possible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Keep Doors and Windows Open - In residential move settings when available, we ask that our
                        customers open (and leave open) outside doors and windows to increase air circulation before and
                        during the move process.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Please wear a mask and gloves while our movers are working. Our movers will be wearing masks
                        on
                        site during initial walkthroughs and closing contracts and we ask that our customers do as
                        well
                        during these times.</p>
